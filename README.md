# ReddiKnowSparse: Infer Traits of Reddit Users from their Comments
### Introduction
- This project develops an end-to-end machine learning pipeline to deduce political sentiment from Reddit comments. With social media's growing influence on political discourse, this tool's capability to analyze sentiments can benefit political campaign optimization, social media post-regulation, and understanding factors affecting public political sentiment.

### Motivation
- In a digital age where data is king, the ability to gauge public opinion on political matters through social media commentary is invaluable. This project addresses the gap in available tools for detailed political sentiment analysis, providing insights into public opinion trends that can inform campaign strategies and regulatory measures.

### Technical Overview
### Data Acquisition and Preprocessing
Utilizing the Pushshift API, we acquired 50,000 comments each from the "LabourUK" and "Tories" subreddits. The RedditDataAcquirer and RedditDataPreprocessor scripts handle data fetching and initial preprocessing, including tokenization and lemmatization, to clean and prepare data for analysis.

###  Feature Extraction
The FeatureExtractor implements TF-IDF and count vectorization to transform textual data into a numerical format, enabling machine learning models to process and learn from the data effectively.

### Model Building and Training
We employed a variety of machine learning models, from traditional algorithms like Random Forest, SVM, and Logistic Regression to advanced deep learning models including CNNs. The process, orchestrated by the ModelBuilder script, involves extensive hyperparameter tuning (detailed in the HyperparameterGridConfigs script) to optimize model performance. Repeated Stratified K-Fold Cross Validation is used along with Grid Search, to search for the best combination of hyperparameters in an unbiased manor.  

### Evaluation and Visualization
Model performances were evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, with results visualized using matplotlib plots generated by the VisualizationPlotter. This comprehensive evaluation approach ensured a clear understanding of each model's effectiveness in sentiment analysis.

### Software Testing
Units tests were produced to test the overall functionality of the pipeline, as 

### Key Findings and Contributions
- TF-IDF Transformation: Significantly improves model performance, especially for KNN and SVM classifiers.
Preprocessing Impact: Universal improvement across all models, underlining the importance of thorough data cleaning and preparation.
- KNN for Text Classification: Found to be less effective compared to other models, particularly before applying TF-IDF and preprocessing steps.
- Optimal Hyperparameters: Detailed analysis and documentation of optimal model configurations, filling a noted gap in existing literature.

### Technologies and Libraries
This project leverages Python for its implementation, with extensive use of libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning, TensorFlow for deep learning models, and matplotlib for data visualization.

### Future Directions
Future work will explore the application of more sophisticated neural network architectures, inclusion of larger and more diverse datasets, and further refinement of preprocessing and feature extraction techniques to enhance model accuracy and reliability.

### Usage and Collaboration
Detailed instructions on setting up and running the pipeline are provided to encourage replication and customization. Contributions are welcomed, especially in the areas of model enhancement, feature expansion, and application to other domains of sentiment analysis.

### Conclusion
This project offers a valuable tool for understanding and leveraging social media discourse in political contexts, as well as performing binary classification between subreddits in general.
