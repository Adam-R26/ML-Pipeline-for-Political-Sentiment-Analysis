## Introduction
- Ever Wondered if we could use fancy ML techniques to infer traits of a Reddit User From their comments?</br>
- If so this repo is for you!
- It provides an End-To-End ML Pipeline for Binary Classification Between Two Subreddits.
- More Specifically in this project it is used to classify users by their different political beliefs i.e, Libetarian or Conservative.
- However it can be changed to work with any two subreddits of your choice by simply changing the config file!
